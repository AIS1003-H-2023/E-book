# PlatformIO

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, 
professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products.

In short, PlatformIO enables you to target different embedded systems, including Arduino, using the same toolchain.

## Installation

Please refer to the [PlatformIO Core (CLI) installation documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html).

### Using PlatformIO with CLion

Recent versions of CLion has first class support for PlatformIO projects. CLion's integration with PlatformIO is provided by the 
[PlatformIO for CLion plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13922-platformio-for-clion?_ga=2.123214155.1374059959.1693506296-72150495.1693506296), 
created in collaboration with the PlatformIO team.

This allows you you write code for both desktop C++ and Arduino within the same editor. No need to use CLion for one thing and Arduino
editor for another and it allows you to use proffesional tooling also for your Arduino projects.

Please have a look at CLion's [Installation section](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/platformio.html#install) for PlatformIO.
