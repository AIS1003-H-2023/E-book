# Terms

Wether you are new to programming in general or just C++, you will encounter a range of new term. 
This page tries to put a meaning to as many such terms as possible.

|Term|Explanation|
|----|-----------|
|argument|Value passed to a function.|
|assignment|Obliterates an objectâ€™s current value and replaces that value by a new one.|
|block|Sequence of zero or more statements enclosed in curly braces.|
|built-in type|Type, such as int, defined by the language.|
|class|Facility for defining our own data structures together with associated operations. The class is one of the most fundamental features in C++. Library types, such as `string` and `vector`, are classes.|
|expression|The smallest unit of computation. An expression consists of one ormore operands and usually one or more operators. Expressions are evaluated to produce a result. For example, assuming i and j are ints, then i + j is an expression and yields the sum of the two int values.|
|function|Named unit of computation.|
|function body|Block that defines the actions performed by a function.|
|function name| Name by which a function is known and can be called.|
|header|Mechanism whereby the definitions of a class or other names are madeavailable to multiple programs. A program uses a header through a #include directive.|
|initialize|Give an object a value at the same time that it is created.|
|main|Function called by the operating system to execute a C++ program. Eachprogram must have one and only one function named main.|
|member function|Operation defined by a class. Member functions ordinarily are called to operate on a specific object.|
|method|Synonym for member function|
|namespace|Mechanism for putting names defined by a library into a single place. Namespaces help avoid inadvertent name clashes. The names defined by the C++ library are in the namespace std.|
|parameter list|Part of the definition of a function. Possibly empty list that specifies what arguments can be used to call the function.|
|variable|A named object.|
